AppSandBox is a Windows application sandbox project focused on monitoring and analyzing program behavior at runtime.

It provides a basic environment for experimenting with:

- Application execution monitoring  
- Windows API activity tracking  
- ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) event collection  
- Dynamic analysis and debugging research  

This project is intended as a learning and research sandbox for Windows internals and security tooling.
